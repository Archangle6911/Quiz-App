A modern, interactive quiz app built with React 

Overview 
The Quiz App is a responsive and user-friendly web application designed to test users' knowledge through multiple-choice questions. it focused on simplicity, clean UI, and smooth user experience while demonstratind core React concepts and front-end best practies.
This project was built as part of my learning journey in Software engineering and front-end development, with an emphasis on real-world structure and deployment readiness.

Fearures 
. Multiple-choice quiz questions
. Real-time score calculation
. Restart quiz functionality
. Clean and intuitive UI design
. Fully responsive (mobile & desktop)
. Fast performance with modern tooling

Technologies Used 
. React (UI development)
